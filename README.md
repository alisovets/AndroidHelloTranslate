## Android Hello Translate


This Helloworld Android program is simple a wrapper around requests to the Google Translate web service.
The program allows to translate a short text phrases and to voice them.
Currently I'm creating a free app where going to use the translation of texts and to voice them by making requests to the Google Translate Web service. I doubt whether Google allows to publish on Google Play applications that uses  their services in such a way. To clarify this point this application was written.

* Min SDK version - 7 (Android 2.1)
